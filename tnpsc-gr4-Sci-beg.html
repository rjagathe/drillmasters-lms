    id: "grade6-physics-measurement-beginner",
    title: "Measurement of Physical Quantities (Beginner)",
    content: "Measurement quantifies physical quantities like length, mass, and time. Length is measured in meters (m); a pencil is about 15 centimeters (cm), and a classroom is around 10 m. Mass is measured in kilograms (kg) using a weighing scale; a school bag weighs about 5 kg, a feather a few grams. Time is measured in seconds (s) with clocks; a sprint takes 10 seconds, a minute is 60 seconds. Tools include rulers for length, balances for mass, and stopwatches for time. The SI system standardizes units globally; a meter is the same everywhere. Farmers measure land in hectares, cooks measure ingredients in grams. Estimating helps in daily life, like judging a table’s length as 1 m or a book’s weight as 1 kg."
  },
  {
    id: "grade6-physics-motion-beginner",
    title: "Motion (Beginner)",
    content: "Motion is the change in an object’s position, like walking or a car moving. Newton’s First Law says an object at rest stays still, and a moving object continues straight unless a force acts. A book stays on a table until pushed; a rolling ball stops due to friction. Friction is a force between surfaces, slowing motion, like a ball on the ground. Bicycles keep moving after pedaling due to inertia but slow due to road friction. Wheels and lubricants, like oil, reduce friction. Fans spin, birds fly, and trains move on tracks, all showing motion. Seatbelts stop your body from moving forward during a car’s sudden stop because of inertia."
  },
  {
    id: "grade6-physics-force-beginner",
    title: "Force (Beginner)",
    content: "Force is a push or pull that changes motion or shape, like kicking a ball or lifting a bag. Newton’s Second Law says force equals mass times acceleration (F = ma). A heavy cart needs more force to push than a light one; faster pushing needs more force. Force is measured in newtons (N); lifting a 1 kg book takes about 10 N. Gravity pulls objects down, friction slows motion, and pushing moves things. Opening a door, throwing a stone, or braking a car all involve forces. A heavy school bag takes more force to lift than a pencil; a fast cricket ball needs more force to stop."
  },
  {
    id: "grade6-physics-pressure-beginner",
    title: "Pressure (Beginner)",
    content: "Pressure is force per unit area, calculated as pressure = force ÷ area, measured in pascals (Pa). A sharp knife cuts better because its small edge area creates high pressure with the same force. Pointed heels sink into soft ground due to high pressure; flat shoes spread weight, reducing pressure. Snowshoes increase area to prevent sinking in snow. A heavy box on a small base has more pressure than on a larger one. Inflating a tire increases pressure inside. Pressing a thumb on a table (small area) feels different from pressing a palm (large area). Water pressure in dams or blood pressure in the body are examples of pressure in action."
  },
  {
    id: "grade6-physics-energy-beginner",
    title: "Energy (Beginner)",
    content: "Energy is the ability to do work, like lifting a book or spinning a fan. Kinetic energy is the energy of motion, like a moving car. Potential energy is stored, like in a stretched rubber band. Energy is measured in joules (J). A wound-up toy has potential energy, released as kinetic energy when moving. Solar panels change light energy to electrical energy. Energy changes forms but isn’t created or destroyed; a falling ball turns potential energy into kinetic energy. A stove gives heat energy for cooking; a flashlight uses chemical energy from batteries to produce light. Running, cooking, or lighting a bulb all need energy."

  {
    id: "grade6-physics-mechanics-beginner",
