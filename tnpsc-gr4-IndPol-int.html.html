It reflects the basic structure doctrine established in the Kesavananda Bharati case (1973), which limits Parliament's power to amend the Constitution’s core values. The Constitution is notable for being the longest written constitution in the world, incorporating features borrowed from various global systems while maintaining a unique balance between rigidity and flexibility."

Article 246 and the Seventh Schedule classify subjects into Union List, State List, and Concurrent List. The Union Government handles national defense, foreign affairs, and railways, while State Governments manage education, public health, and local governance. Union Territories operate under the direct control of the Central Government, though some, like Delhi and Puducherry, have limited self-governance. This framework ensures administrative efficiency while respecting regional diversity."
