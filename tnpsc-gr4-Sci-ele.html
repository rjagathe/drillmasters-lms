 const scienceContent = [
  {
    id: "grade7-physics-motion-types-elementary",
    title: "Types of Motion (Elementary)",
    content: "Motion describes how objects change position over time. Uniform motion occurs when an object moves at a constant speed in a straight line, like a train cruising steadily. Non-uniform motion involves changing speed or direction, such as a car accelerating or turning. Velocity combines speed and direction, so a car moving north at 60 km/h has a specific velocity. Displacement measures the shortest path from start to end, unlike distance, which may include detours. For example, walking 5 meters east from a tree is displacement. Understanding motion types helps predict object behavior in real-world scenarios like traffic or sports."
  },
  {
    id: "grade7-physics-simple-machines-elementary",
    title: "Simple Machines (Elementary)",
    content: "Simple machines make work easier by reducing effort or changing force direction. A lever, like a seesaw, uses a fulcrum to lift heavy objects with less force. Pulleys, found in flagpoles, redirect force to lift loads. Inclined planes, such as ramps, allow heavy items to be moved with less effort. Wedges, like knives, split or cut materials. Screws hold objects tightly, and wheels reduce friction for movement. Each machine multiplies human effort, making tasks like lifting, cutting, or moving efficient. Simple machines are foundational in tools and complex machinery used daily."
  },
  {
    id: "grade7-physics-light-refraction-elementary",
    title: "Light and Refraction (Elementary)",
    content: "Refraction is the bending of light as it passes between mediums, like air to water, due to changes in light’s speed. This makes a straw in water appear bent. Glass slows light more than water, causing greater bending. Lenses and prisms use refraction to focus or split light, as in glasses or rainbows. Unlike reflection, where light bounces off surfaces, refraction alters light’s path. Understanding refraction explains optical phenomena, like why pools appear shallower. It’s crucial in designing optical devices, such as microscopes, telescopes, and cameras, which rely on precise light manipulation."
  },
  {
    id: "grade7-physics-circuits-elementary",
    title: "Electric Circuits (Elementary)",
    content: "Electric circuits allow current to flow through a path of conductors, powered by a source like a battery. In a series circuit, current follows a single path, so if one component, like a bulb, fails, the entire circuit stops. Voltage, measured in volts, drives the current, while conductors like copper wires allow flow. Insulators, like rubber, prevent unwanted flow. Circuits power devices like lamps and fans. Understanding circuits helps design safe electrical systems and troubleshoot issues, such as fixing a broken light string, by ensuring proper connections and component functionality."
  },
  {
    id: "grade7-physics-energy-forms-elementary",
    title: "Forms of Energy (Elementary)",
    content: "Energy is the ability to do work and exists in various forms. Kinetic energy is the energy of motion, like a moving car. Potential energy is stored energy, such as water behind a dam. Chemical energy in fuels like coal releases heat when burned. Heat, light, and sound are other forms. Energy transforms, like when a battery’s chemical energy becomes light in a bulb. Renewable sources, like solar, are sustainable, unlike coal. Understanding energy forms helps in conserving resources and designing efficient systems, such as solar panels or wind turbines, for everyday use."
  },
  {
    id: "grade7-physics-sound-elementary",
    title: "Sound (Elementary)",
    content: "Sound is produced by vibrations traveling as waves through mediums like air, water, or solids. Solids transmit sound fastest because their particles are closely packed. Pitch depends on vibration frequency—higher frequency means higher pitch, like a whistle. Amplitude affects loudness; larger vibrations create louder sounds. Sound cannot travel in a vacuum, unlike light. In daily life, sound is crucial for communication, music, and warnings, like sirens. Understanding sound helps design better acoustics in auditoriums or noise-canceling headphones, and explains phenomena like echoes in caves or why voices sound different underwater."
  },
  {
    id: "grade7-physics-gravity-elementary",
    title: "Gravity (Elementary)",
    content: "Gravity is a pull force that attracts objects toward each other, like Earth pulling objects downward. It depends on mass and distance—larger masses or closer objects have stronger gravity. For example, Earth’s gravity keeps us grounded, while the Moon’s weaker gravity allows higher jumps. Gravity causes objects to fall and planets to orbit the Sun. It’s different from friction or magnetism. Understanding gravity helps explain natural phenomena, like tides caused by the Moon, and is essential in fields like astronomy and engineering, such as designing satellites or predicting planetary motion."
  },
  {
    id: "grade7-physics-pressure-elementary",
    title: "Pressure (Elementary)",
    content: "Pressure is the force applied per unit area, measured in pascals. A sharp knife exerts high pressure because force is concentrated on a small area, making cutting easier. In liquids, pressure increases with depth, which is why divers feel more pressure underwater. In gases, pressure rises when compressed, like in a tire. Atmospheric pressure affects weather; low pressure often brings rain. Understanding pressure is vital in designing tools, vehicles, and structures, like dams that withstand water pressure or airplanes that balance air pressure. It also explains daily phenomena, like drinking through a straw."
  },
  {
    id: "grade7-physics-friction-elementary",
    title: "Friction (Elementary)",
    content: "Friction is a force that opposes motion between surfaces, like shoes gripping the ground. Rough surfaces, like sandpaper, create more friction than smooth ones, like glass. Friction slows objects, generates heat, and wears out materials, like tires. It can be reduced with lubricants, like oil in engines, or increased for grip, like rubber soles. While friction is essential for walking or braking, excessive friction wastes energy.
